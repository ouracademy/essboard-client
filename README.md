### Tips
#### Formatting
We use Prettier as our formatting tool, to have a formatting standard.

If you want to use prettier in an existing project, it's recommended to format your entire project for the first time, by running:

`./node_modules/.bin/prettier --single-quote --write "src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json,css,scss,md,html}"`

#### Editor

We use VS code as our main editor. If you use it, when you clone this repo, VS code will ask you to install our recommended extensions. Please install them, it'll help you in your development ðŸ˜„
